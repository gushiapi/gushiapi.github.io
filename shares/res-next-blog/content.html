It should be not only defined by similarity in the representation (CLIP), but also by certain tasks. The CLIP maps an image into a space aligned with the caption, which is typically a subspace of the information that can be represented by the image.

For example, there are different types of eyes. These eyes are represented by genes. How can we build the similar “design” or “encode” system? Or even more, can we talk whether such a system is efficient? If it is, how can we design one with similar efficiency?</li></ol><ol type="a" id="67d8e567-effa-49b6-8284-f8ad5a62f20b" class="numbered-list" start="6"><li>We can either build AI through connection and symbols.
