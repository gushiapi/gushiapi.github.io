            <h3>Our Ultimate Goal: Super Intelligence</h3>
            <p>
                In order to finally realize our final goal, we learn from the known most powerful intelligence system, the human brain. We aim to model brain-like structures, learn through plasticity, and reason towards alignment. In this way, we can develop a system that is capable of understanding and reasoning about the world in a way that is aligned with human values and intentions. The Brain-Inspired Alignment Intelligence system represents a pathway inspired by neural structures and cognitive mechanisms, aiming for general intelligence alignment from structure and mechanics to cognitive reasoning. Specially, we have three main research goals:<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Goal 1: Develop efficient neural plasticity inspired learning algorithms.</strong><br>
                <strong>Goal 2: Investigate the interpretable principles acorss different intelligent systems.</strong><br>
                <strong>Goal 3: Build real-time closed-loop neurofeedback interface with controllable stimuli.</strong>

                    <p>We aim to develop a system that can learn and adapt in a way that is similar to how the human brain learns. This involves creating models that can change and adapt based on new information, allowing the system to improve its performance over time.</p>

                    <p>We aim to create a system that can align its goals and actions with those of the human brain. This involves understanding the cognitive processes of the brain and developing models that can mimic these processes, allowing the system to work in harmony with human intelligence.</p>

                <div id="Neurofeedback" class="tab-panel" style="display:none;">
                    <img src="assets/goal_3.png" alt="Closed-loop Neurofeedback" class="tab-image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    <p>We aim to develop a closed-loop neurofeedback interface that allows for real-time interaction between the system and the human brain. This involves creating models that can process and respond to brain signals, enabling a dynamic and adaptive interaction that enhances learning and performance.</p>
