            <h3>The Pursuit of Aligned Super Intelligence</h3>
            <p>
                Our lab is on a quest to realize super intelligence by unlocking the principles of the human brain. We believe the path to truly advanced AI lies in modeling brain-like architectures, learning through adaptive plasticity, and reasoning in a manner that is fundamentally aligned with human cognition. By integrating these biological principles, we aim to develop systems that can understand and navigate the world in synergy with human values. Our research is driven by three key missions:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Goal 1: Engineer efficient learning algorithms based on the principles of neural plasticity.</strong><br>
                <strong>Goal 2: Uncover the interpretable, foundational principles shared across different intelligent systems.</strong><br>
                <strong>Goal 3: Construct real-time, closed-loop neurofeedback systems for precise neural stimulation.</strong>
            </p>

                    <p>We aim to develop a system that can learn and adapt in a way that is similar to how the human brain learns. This involves creating models that can change and adapt based on new information, allowing the system to improve its performance over time.</p>

                    <p>We aim to create a system that can align its goals and actions with those of the human brain. This involves understanding the cognitive processes of the brain and developing models that can mimic these processes, allowing the system to work in harmony with human intelligence.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="Neurofeedback" class="tab-panel" style="display:none;">
                    <img src="assets/goal_3.png" alt="Closed-loop Neurofeedback" class="tab-image" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    <p>We aim to develop a closed-loop neurofeedback interface that allows for real-time interaction between the system and the human brain. This involves creating models that can process and respond to brain signals, enabling a dynamic and adaptive interaction that enhances learning and performance.</p>
