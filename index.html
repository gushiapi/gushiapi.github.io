                 <p>The Brain and Intelligence Lab, led by Professor Shi Gu, is part of Zhejiang University's State Key Lab of Brain Machine Intelligence and studies brain-inspired learning and network controllability.</p>
                 <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Professional Bio:</strong> I am now a tenured associate professor at the <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University</a>, where I am leading the Brain and Intelligence group at the State Key Lab of Brain Machine Intelligence. I completed my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=193">Dr. Dani S. Bassett</a> from the <a href="https://complexsystemsupenn.com/">Complex System Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. Before that, I spent four years (2007-2011) in <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Tsinghua University</a> for my undergraduate degree in the Academic Talent Program, majoring in mathematics and physics.</p>
                 <p><strong>Research Interests:</strong> Our main interest is the Brain-inspired Alignment Intelligence, i.e. <em>modelling brain-like structure, learning through plasticity, and reasoning towards alignment</em>. Specially, it covers computational neuroscience, brain inspired intelligence, medical imaging analysis, neural encoding and decoding, and spiking neural networks. &nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;</p>
                 <p>I am looking for self-motivated students, postdoctoral researchers, and research assistants to join our team. If you are interested in working with me, welcome to send me an email. I am open to exploring remote collaborations as well.</p>
